**🤖 AI Interview Simulator: From Ghosted to Growth**

“Why just prepare harder… when you can build smarter?”

After getting ghosted more times than I can count this interview season 👻, I had an aha moment. Instead of endlessly prepping, what if I built a real solution to the problem?
So, I did. Enter:

👉🏽 A realistic AI-powered interview simulator that gives the kind of actionable feedback I always wished I had as a job seeker.


**🎬 The Backstory**

Job hunting is tough—let’s be honest:
	Mock interviews? Robotic.
	Mirror practice? Awkward.
	Advice blogs? Generic.

I wanted something that felt real—like sitting across from a tough but fair hiring manager who actually challenges you.

So, I built “Alex”, an AI interviewer powered by Google Gemini AI and web tech magic.
This isn’t just a passion project—it’s my way of turning rejection into resilience, using my skills in tech and product thinking.


**⚙️ My Role**

Full transparency: I’m a Product Management enthusiast and former Software Engineer, not a full-time dev. My superpowers lie in:

🕵️‍♂️ Understanding real user pain points
🗺️ Designing thoughtful, actionable solutions
🧪 Testing MVPs to validate ideas

How I built it? With AI-assisted dev tools, focusing on functionality and user experience over flash.
This project proves what I believe deeply:
A product thinker with the right tools can ship working software—fast.


**🧠 Key Features**

✨ Conversational Interviews
Alex doesn’t just read questions from a script—he asks relevant follow-ups in real time.

🎙️ Voice-to-Voice Interaction
Talk to Alex, he talks back. Like a Zoom call with a future hiring manager (minus the anxiety).

📝 Live Captions
All conversations are transcribed in real-time. Accessibility matters 💯.

📊 Performance Reports
Get detailed feedback on Product Sense, Problem Solving, Communication, and more—with actionable insights.


🖥️ Sleek UI
A video-call style interface with light & dark mode because vibes matter ✨.
